• Write code to create an array named scores and fill it with 5 test scores 10,
20, 30, 40 and 50.
• Now write a function named findAverage, that takes an array as an
argument and return average of the array values.
• Call findAverage function passing array you created in step1 and save the
return result in a variable, average.
• Print the average, it should be 30 for this example.
• Create a second array filled with 10 random values between 0 to 10 and
find the average of the array values.
• Should compute correct average for an array of any size.
